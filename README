I love to be a master of my web. RSS is a very fine tool to make that happen. Sadly, not all of my favorite sites have the same perception of what the feed should look like.
food4feed project is intended to address this issue by allowing user to generate feeds from html pages.
This is also an opportunity for me to try out brilliant hobo on rails (http://www.hobocentral.net/).

More info to come as things take shape.
